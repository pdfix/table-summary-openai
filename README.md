## Getting Started

To use this Docker application, you'll need to have Docker installed on your system. If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install it.


## Run using Command Line Interface

To run the docker container as CLI, you should share the folder containing the PDF for processing using the `-i` parameter. In this example, the current folder is used.

```bash 
docker run -v $(pwd):/data/ -w /data pdfix/alt-text-openai:latest detect -i document.pdf -o out.pdf --tags "Figure|Formula" --openai <api_key> --lang English --overwrite true
```

With an account-based PDFix License add these arguments.
```bash
--name ${LICENSE_NAME} --key ${LICENSE_KEY}
```
Contact support for more infomation.

First run will pull the docker image, which may take some time. Make your own image for more advanced use.

For more detailed information about the available command-line arguments, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm pdfix/alt-text-openai:latest --help
```
